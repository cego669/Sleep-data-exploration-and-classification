# Sleep data exploration and classification

*This repository contains the notebook with the exploratory analysis and modeling of sleep data from a Wistar rat.*

**Objective:** to **analyze** and **explore**, using different Data Science tools, sleep data extracted from a Wistar rat.

**About the data:** The data contains total power values in unitary frequency bands for different epochs (10-second chunks in time) and classification, by an experienced researcher, into AWAKE, NREM, or REM, with the latter two being different phases of sleep.
